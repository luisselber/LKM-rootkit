# LKM rootkit
 This Linux Kernel Module is developed as a project for the Kernel Implementation subject at PUC Campinas. The module acts as a rootkit, intercepting the compilation or interpretation of C and Python files in the operating system. It searches for a specific and predefined sentence in the code and replaces it with another predefined sentence.
